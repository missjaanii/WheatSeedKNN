# WheatseedKNN
Applied a KNN model algorithm on Wheat seed dataset. Also showed some pairplots. I used the test size of 0.475 which gave me accurate results. It might not work for you so try the trial and error method for near-perfect results.

To construct the data, seven geometric parameters (features) of wheat kernels were measured:

area A,
perimeter P,
compactness C = 4piA/P^2,
length of kernel,
width of kernel,
asymmetry coefficient
length of kernel groove.
target (0,1,2)
